Aim: The project aims at displaying the contents of a resource grid of an LTE network
consistent with their positions in radio frame. The contents of the resource grid include
various signals and channels present in the physical layer of the network such as PSS:
Primary Synchronization signal, SSS: Secondary Synchronization signal, RS Reference
signal, PBCH: Physical Broadcast channel, PDCCH: Physical Downlink control channel,
PCFICH: Physical Control Format Indicator Channel, PHICH: Physical Hybrid ARQ
indicator channel and PDSCH: Physical Downlink shared channel.


Objectives: The objectives include addressing the significance of simulations in
implementation of Real time cellular networks, understanding LTE physical layer and
placement of various signals and channels in resource grid. Our objectives also include
creating a user interface, programming positions of different channels and signals in a radio
frame accurately.
